I am the Principal Statistician for the HRB Clinical Research Facility in Cork, Ireland, and a Senior Lecturer in Research Methods at UCC. I collaborate and consult on a large and varied portfolio of patient-focused and public health research projects. My primary goal is to work with investigators to help ensure that their study designs and methods for data analysis are appropriate. 

I am also interested in methodological research, particularly in the areas of longitudinal and latent variable statistical modelling, and analysis of compositional data (e.g. body composition, microbiome studies). Lastly, I am a statistics editor for the Journal for the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, and conduct related research on the relationships between infant nutrition and growth with life long cardio-metabolic health.
