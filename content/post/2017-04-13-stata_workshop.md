## Introduction to data analysis with Stata ##

On May 24, 2017, the Clinical Research Facility Cork will host a one-day workshop featuring Stata data analysis and statistical software. It will take place in the Brookfield Health Sciences Building (G07) at University College Cork. The workshop will be led by Dr Darren Dahly, the Principal Statistician at the CRF-C. 

The workshop is free for registered PhD students. Otherwise, the cost is 75 EUR and can be paid by credit card or purchase order (for UCC based attendees). To sign up, please email Darren (ddahly@ucc.ie). You will then be given payment details. 

The workshop (9:45 to 16:15) will introduce Stata to researchers with little or no experience using it. Participants will learn how to load data and produce descriptive summaries, including tables and graphs, how to edit and modify data, and how to carry out analyses such as t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA and regression. We will also demonstrate how Stata can be used to support reproducible research practices.
