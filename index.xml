&lt;p&gt;To get a job, you have to get an interview. Who knows what will happen at that point, but securing an interview is at least partly in your own hands. Having just finished shortlisting the applicants to a postdoctoral research post I recently advertised, here are my thoughts on how to get your foot further in the door. None of this is original. It’s just fresh on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;your-letter-must-be-well-written-and-fit-for-purpose&#34;&gt;Your letter must be well written and fit for purpose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people seem to think the letter is just a “Hello, my name is Bob, and I am applying for this job.” I can assure you that it is so much more than that. First, I get to see if you can write. Whether you want to believe it or not, academics are professional writers. It’s a skill you will use all the time, and the letter is your best way to show me you have it. It’s not just about the grammar either. People who write well also tend to think well, organize well, and argue well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the letter shows me how good you are at research, which is obviously an important skill for our profession. What do you know about me? What do you know about where I work? What do you know about the job you are applying for?  If you don’t do this simple piece of research, when there so much at stake for you, why would anyone trust you to do more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;send-a-professional-looking-cv&#34;&gt;Send a professional looking CV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention to detail matters. Let’s say we just completed a clinical trial. Many smart people worked hard on the project, patients took on real risks to participate, and we spent lots of somebody else’s money. Now I need you to analyse the data from that trial, and write up the results. A lot is riding on the job you do. How can I trust this to someone who can’t get the margins of their CV to line up? It’s not like your CV is something you have to write every day, so it shouldn’t be that difficult to write a nice one and update it as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;demonstrate-how-you-meet-the-criteria&#34;&gt;Demonstrate how you meet the criteria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about every job description has a list of criteria. If you don’t appear to meet the criteria, then I can’t put you ahead of the applicants that do. Some criteria are easy to verify, such as your degree, or prior experience. Other things aren’t as obvious, so you need to make sure that you point these out in the letter. When you are done, give the job description along with your CV and letter to a friend or mentor and see if they can match it all up. If they can’t, keep working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;don-t-publish-in-dodgy-journals&#34;&gt;Don’t publish in dodgy journals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate that academia is so focused on papers, and I could care less about impact factors - but you can’t have a CV full of papers published in the Galactic International Journal of Financial Biochemistry. It&amp;rsquo;s not always easy to know for sure that a journal is dodgy, but in some cases it is, so stay away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;appeal-to-the-pis-interests-and-values&#34;&gt;Appeal to the PIs interests and values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, if you want to work with me, it’s a good idea to learn about me (just as I will try to learn about you). Many academics are now active on social media, so go check them out. We all publish papers, so go read some of them. If you learn that we share an interest that is relevant to the job, then make that clear in your application. This isn’t just vanity. I am looking to start a professional relationship with someone that might last a few decades, so your chances of getting an interview shoot up if we already share some common ground.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Defense of DAGs</title>
      <link>/post/2017-03-30-dags/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Professors Nancy Krieger (NK) and George Davey Smith (GDS) recently published an editorial in the IJE titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27694566&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The tale wagged by the DAG: broadening the scope of causal inference and explanation for epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;. In it, they argue that causal inference in epidemiology is dominated by an approach characterised by counterfactuals (or potential outcomes) and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); and that this hegemony is limiting the scope of our field, and preventing us from adopting a more useful, pluralistic view of causality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They began their editorial with the results of a literature search of &lt;code&gt;[epidemiology AND causal AND inference]&lt;/code&gt;. They found 558 such articles, none of which were published before 1990, and half of which were published after 2010. I believe they were trying to show that causal inference is becoming a more important topic to epidemiologists. However, if that was the case, I think it makes more sense to ask how many papers mention causal inference &lt;em&gt;out of&lt;/em&gt; the papers published in our field. After all, in epidemiology, it’s all about the denominators. Once you do this, a much more important problem appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to their search, I started by looking for papers on Pubmed from the last five years that were published in the four key epidemiological journals where most of the discussion about causal inference probably takes place. These were: &lt;em&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the International Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&lt;/em&gt;. Then, out of these papers, I alternately searched for those mentioning causal inference; those mentioning DAGs; and those mentioning counterfactuals. The results are plotted below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://DarrenDahly.github.io/img/plot.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Search 1: (&amp;quot;J Epidemiol Community Health&amp;quot; [journal] OR &amp;quot;Am J Epidemiol&amp;quot; [journal] OR &amp;quot;Int J Epidemiol&amp;quot; [journal] OR &amp;quot;Epidemiology&amp;quot; [journal])
Search 2: Search 1 AND &amp;quot;causal inference&amp;quot;
Search 3: Search 1 AND (causal graph* OR &amp;quot;DAGs&amp;quot; OR &amp;quot;DAG&amp;quot; OR directed acyclic graph*)
Search 4: Search 1 AND (counterfactual OR potential outcomes) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of course supports NK and GDS’s assertion that counterfactuals and DAGs dominate our discussion of causal inference, but I am much more worried about how limited that discussion appears to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many others,&lt;a href=&#34;http://dantalus.github.io/2017/02/04/consequentialism/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; I have previously argued that there is far too little causal thinking in epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;. The plot above is consistent with this view, and won&amp;rsquo;t allow me to accept that DAGs and counterfactuals are now pervasive enough to warrant some cautionary backlash. I instead believe that DAGs and counterfactuals, rather than displacing a more pluralistic view of causal inference, are actually &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; the space for it to exist.  Unfortunately, in an otherwise excellent  and informative editorial, I think that NK and GDS misrepresent counterfactuals and DAGs, and worry that this might actually discourage their use. With that in mind, I offer the following commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story-of-a-useful-wrench-denigrated-for-not-being-a-perfect-hammer&#34;&gt;The story of a useful wrench, denigrated for not being a perfect hammer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions of causal inference in epidemiology are often seen as “high-level”, or somehow beyond the rank-and-file epidemiologists. This is unfortunate, since drawing causal inferences from observational data is probably the biggest challenge we all regularly face. In my opinion, the single best way to help them meet this challenge is to teach them about counterfactuals and DAGs, which I have been doing for almost 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious value of DAGs for epidemiologists is that they facilitate a rigorous and transparent means of deciding which variables to adjust for when you hope to draw causal inferences from associations. They are especially helpfully for identifying tricky situations where adjustment for a possible confounder will actually create more bias than it resolves (e.g. collider bias).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, DAGs can be used to describe competing sets of theory-based predictions that can be checked against data (Science!). They can be communicated unambiguously to others, so that disagreements about a DAG’s specific form can be debated and evaluated. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15308962&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DAGs can be used to describe most (if not all?) of the many biases&lt;/a&gt; researchers have identified, and re-identified, over the years. They are also helpful for contrasting study designs and the different assumptions they rely on (including Mendelian randomization, which I have never successfully described to anyone without using a DAG).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on. I love DAGs, for all the reasons above and more. But the thing I love most about DAGs is that they encourage the exact kind of pluralistic causal thinking that NK and GDS advocate for in their editorial. For example, NK and GDS say the following about an approach to causal inference they admire, inference to the best explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, the essence of the IBE approach is to ‘think through inferential problems in causal rather than logical terms’ and to employ a ‘two-stage mechanism involving the generation of candidate hypotheses and then section among them’. IBE is thus driven by theory, substantive knowledge, and evidence, as opposed to being driven solely by logic or by probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read this, I thought it was a spot-on explanation of the kind of thinking DAGs facilitate. In fact, many of the other good ideas they shared were things that could be described and justified using counterfactuals and DAGs, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PophamFrank/status/846836389853511680&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;including each of the things listed in Textbox 3&lt;/a&gt;. While reading their editorial, I couldn’t help feeling like NK and GDS weren’t giving DAGs the credit they deserve for promoting a deeper level of causal thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The editorial also kept pointing out things that DAGs can’t be used for, but most of it was in a “no duh” kind of way. It was like warning me my car doesn&amp;rsquo;t drive under water. Strangely though, their key example of how DAGs go wrong was instead a perfect description of how they go right. It was the bit about the birth weight paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, maternal smoking is associated with neonatal mortality, which won’t come as a surprise to anyone. However, if you only look at very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, there seems to be a protective effect, i.e. neonatal mortality is lower among infants born to moms who smoke. However, using a DAG, one can quite easily argue that because VLBW is a consequence of maternal smoking, stratifying by birth weights (which is what happens once we look at only the VLBW infants) leads to a collider bias. The collider bias in turn suggests the following: if you take a VLBW baby, and their mom didn’t smoke, then it’s more likely they were exposed to some other nasty insult that causes their VLBW, and that this alternate exposure was even more strongly associated with mortality. I teach this example every year. It’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seemingly dissatisfied with this conclusion, NK and GDS go on to say that an “elaborate and biologically plausible alternative explanation exists”. However, their explanation is 100% consistent with what others have suggested based on collider bias I just described. I quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that infants who are low-birthweight for reasons other than smoking may well have experienced harms during their fetal development unrelated to and much worse than those imposed by smoking…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They then note that their “proposed alternative biological explanation cannot be discerned from a DAG”, but also that “the DAGs for collider bias and for heterogeneity of LBW phenotypes have a similar structure.” I found this astounding, and can’t fathom why NK and GDS don’t see that they have the exact same structure. The only difference is that they have attached biologically informed labels to the nodes of the graph. Hence, while arguing the DAG is limited, they demonstrate that it actually worked as intended. It has described a causal structure that explains an otherwise paradoxical finding, to which they have added their own expert knowledge to further increase our belief that the DAG is correctly specified.  This is how DAGs work. They are just a tool. They are not magical. Garbage-In-Garbage-Out applies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-counterfactuals&#34;&gt;Back to counterfactuals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the plot above, I fail to see how a counterfactual view of cause threatens to narrow the scope of our field, considering that just under 1% of papers from the best epidemiological journals even mention it. Further, I don’t see where NK and GDS offer any actual evidence of this occurring. What they offer instead is a more philosophical critique of counterfactuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They focus on a particularly “alarming feature” of counterfactualism, which is the idea that race or ethnicity can’t cause poor health (or anything else) because it isn’t intervenable. They then go onto to discuss that this “belief fails to acknowledge reams of genetic evidence demonstrating that H sapiens cannot be meaningfully parsed into discrete genetically distinct races…” They go on in this vein for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit, I had to re-read all of it several times before I could allow myself to conclude the following: NK and GDS aren’t just accusing counterfactualists of holding a debateable view of causality; they are accusing them of holding a deeply offensive and ignorant view of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please let me be very clear. A counterfactual view of race doesn’t mean you think that there are “fixed races.” The counterfactual view of race doesn’t say race can’t be changed, or even that it exists. It doesn’t say that race is a “natural kind”. It doesn’t say we shouldn’t study it (and thus “narrow the scope” of our field). To me, the counterfactual view simply says that race can’t be the target of intervention. It says that race doesn’t cause poor health, racism does – which is the exact point NK and GDS get to at while arguing against the counterfactual view. I hope everyone can see the distinction, and nobody is put off of  counterfactuals for fear of offending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to provide a less contentious example that I teach to my students, which will hopefully explain their value. Does fluoride prevent dental carries? This might seem like a straightforward causal question, but it is woefully incomplete without consideration of how we might vary exposure to fluoride. For example, we could fluoridate the water supply, dictate that manufacturers put more fluoride in toothpaste, or encourage people to brush their teeth more often. Each of these interventions represents a distinct causal question, with different sets of potential confounders, taking place at different scales, and all of them are more useful than simply asking whether fluoride prevents tooth decay. So counterfactuals are, at the very least, a useful fiction that I believe help crystalize causal questions. Even in situations where there is no possible intervention, due to ethical or other constraints, thinking about exposures as if you could intervene can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A colleague once told me that Jamie Robbins, when asked what a confounder was, answered, “Whatever you need to adjust for to get the right answer.” I think this answer really gets to the point of DAGs and their counterfactual foundations. It’s not about identifying what &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A confounder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is, but rather it’s about identifying the set of things to adjust for, given a specific causal question, asked in a specific context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in stark contrast to what I see in most health research papers. The process of covariate selection, typically the crux of the entire analysis, is often omitted. When it isn’t, it can frequently be described as a monkey-see-monkey-do approach, or even worse, by some step-wise algorithm. Then, after dancing around the causal question at hand, careful not to admit their true motives, the authors are usually quick to practically apologize for their efforts with that old falsehood, “Correlation doesn’t imply causation.” All of this reflects a deficit of causal thinking that is a drag on our profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAGs and counterfactual thinking are currently the best tools we have to counter this. Their value seems so obvious to me, but clearly not to everyone else. Every year, a student will inevitably ask, “If DAGs are so useful, why don’t epidemiologists use them?” I still don’t have a good answer for that question. It’s been about two decades since &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9888278&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Robins, Greenland, Pearl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15308962&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hernan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://publicifsv.sund.ku.dk/~nk/epiF14/Glymour_DAGs.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Glymour&lt;/a&gt; and others helped to introduce DAGs to our field. It would be generous to describe their uptake as slow.  There is no denying that most “successful” epidemiologists have gotten along just fine without them, and they rarely appear in the journal articles I read or review. So please forgive any defensiveness on my part; just know that we are on an uphill climb here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your science is justified by the question, not the answer</title>
      <link>/post/2017-03-21-prereg/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Registration of clinical trials, prior to any patient recruitment, is now common. Though trial registrations often omit the important details regarding their proposed analyses (despite advice to the contrary), most trialists seem to agree, at least in principle, that you should transparently describe your plans for clinical trial data before they are collected. Unfortunately, this remains a foreign concept in other areas of clinical and public health research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I started working as a biostatistician involved in clinical trials, I worked with birth cohort studies. Whereas the vast majority of clinical trials are designed to answer a single research question (or small set of them), the prospective cohort study design allows researchers to answer many questions, even thousands, including questions that nobody envisioned at the start of the study. Given the costs of recruiting and following-up hundreds or thousands of study participants, many believe that it’s our responsibility to extract as much value from these data as we can. However, this well-intentioned mind-set can quickly be distorted to promote toxic research practices, where perverse incentives to publish, combined with the poor overall quality of peer-review, have created a body of flawed, often useless, research with results affected by various forms of p-hacking (intentional or otherwise) and file-drawer effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine that most people reading this will be well aware of these issues, but the world of cohort studies has done little, in my opinion, to address them. Pre-registration of planned data analyses would go a long way to solving these problems, which has been repeatedly suggested by many others. The key questions then are where should people register their analyses, and how can we realistically compel them to do so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research funders have played an important role in the open access research movement, through decree, and by covering the costs of open access publishing. They must play a similar role in the pre-registration of data analyses. I believe that any new cohort study should be required by the funder to maintain a transparent, current list of the analyses they plan to conduct. Many studies already use some form of a publication committee to plan research outputs, so this would be a natural extension of their work. These study-specific registries could be hosted using a variety of online, easy to use, low-cost tools that provide a timestamp and DOI. Most importantly, funders should then require researchers to update progress on the registered analyses as a part of their regular reporting processes (hopefully replacing the less useful information that is often asked for). Subsequent manuscripts should then reference the respective analysis registration(s), and take the opportunity to justify any departures in the supplemental material. I also suspect such public registries would help identify helpful collaborators, and justify when researchers might prefer to not yet share the study data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don’t see a substantial logistical challenge to cohort studies maintaining their own registry of planned data analyses, I suspect that many reading this will think that it’s impossible none-the-less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why: I continue to collaborate on cohort studies that I didn’t design, where my involvement is typically sought long after the data have been collected. I will typically ask my colleagues to first send me a draft of the introduction and the methods of recruitment and measurement, as if we were preparing a manuscript. I then tell them that I will add the appropriate statistical methods and a dispassionate summary of the results, including the tables and plots, after which we will plan to meet minds, outline the discussion, and start editing the paper. This request almost always causes discomfort, even when everyone acknowledges it’s just a process to move things along. People always want to see the results first. In my opinion, this is because we have adopted a view of science where the justification for a research project is given by the results. But this is completely backwards! It’s the question that drives us. Is it important enough to answer? And can it be answered in a scientific manner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, you should be able to start drafting a manuscript before the data are collected, much less analysed (using exactly what went into your grant and/or ethics application). This shouldn’t cause any discomfort at all. This is the standard we should all strive to attain. This propensity to want to see the results first and then spin the paper (and that’s exactly what it is – spin) is harming science, and those who want to discredit science are starting to exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://darrendahly.github.io/img/crfc_banner.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ucc.ie/en/crfc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clinical Research Facility Cork&lt;/a&gt; is sponsoring a free, two-day introduction to data analysis using the R statistical programming language on March 30th and 31st (Th, F), from 09:30 to 16:30 in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.ie/maps/place/Western+Gateway,+Western+Gateway+Building,+University+College+Cork,+Western+Rd,+Mardyke,+Cork/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4844902fb2cfc8d3:0xbc1521a27a3ca450?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRn-H2-pbQAhWDLMAKHStcCXwQ8gEIGzAA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Western Gateway Building&lt;/a&gt; 3.71. Places are available on a first-come, first-serve basis, and there is space for 10 participants. Please email me at ddahly@ucc.ie to reserve a place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is intended for people who are new to R, but at least somewhat familiar with other statistical software such as Stata or SPSS. Each participant will need to being their own laptop with R and R-Studio Desktop installed and working. Once these are installed, you will need to execute the following code: &lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. You are also encouraged to “bring your own data” to work with (in any format).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The strengths and weaknesses of R, relative to other options for data analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basics of &amp;ldquo;how R works&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with the R-Studio environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workflow and managing projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importing data into R (from Excel, Stata, SAS, SPSS, text files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with dataframes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data visualisation with ggplot2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing your own functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literate programming and reproducible research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the workshop, you will be able to import a dataset into R, manipulate it, visualize it, and then wrap everything up in a report that can be reproduced at the press of a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more R related activities, please feel free to join the Cork R-User&amp;rsquo;s Group &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cork-Ireland-R-Users-Group/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cause vs. Consequence</title>
      <link>/post/2017-02-04-consequentialism/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2017-02-04-consequentialism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have, for some time, wanted to respond to Sandro Galea&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/178/8/1185/84205/An-Argument-for-a-Consequentialist-Epidemiology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;essay on a Consequentialist Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2013 (!) in the American Journal of Epidemiology. It is hard to argue against the importance of consequentialism for academic epidemiology. It is equally hard to dismiss Galea&amp;rsquo;s concerns about our lack of influence with funders and policy makers. However, my views beyond this diverge from Professor Galea&amp;rsquo;s, and in the spirit of his &amp;ldquo;provocation,&amp;rdquo; I would like to respectfully offer an alternate perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galea seems primarily concerned that academic epidemiology is focused too much on identifying causes of disease, and not enough on actual intervention. He further worries that &amp;ldquo;our focus on causal rather than pragmatic thinking&amp;rdquo; risks marginalizing us with funders and policy makers. His solution to this problem is to promote a &amp;ldquo;consequentialist epidemiology&amp;rdquo; that is intensely focused on improving health outcomes, even &amp;ldquo;at the expense of the development of epidemiological methods and novel approaches.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up the need for a consequentialist epidemiology, Galea points to key epidemiological textbooks and journals as evidence that we are too focused on etiology and not focused enough on intervention. The former, he observes, don&amp;rsquo;t teach students how to intervene, and the latter are too focused on etiological research and publish relatively few papers about actual interventions. Though his observations are surely accurate, I think they reflect too narrow a view of academic epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We train in schools of public health, where we are expected to study a range of topics that often includes intervention design and evaluation. We typically work in the same, or similarly diverse, institutions, where our expertise contributes to a variety of public health research programs, and is published widely. The interventions we contribute to have a better chance of appearing in &amp;ldquo;high impact&amp;rdquo; journals, while our etiological research and innovative methods are appropriately showcased for our peers in the &amp;ldquo;core epidemiological&amp;rdquo; journals. It is thus no suprise that &amp;ldquo;our&amp;rdquo; journals are focused on method, and in no way does this reflect a lack of consequentialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that being said, of course we are preoccupied with etiology and cause! Definitive answers to causal questions are rare, but if we want to intelligently inform intervention efforts, we must continue to pursue them - even in observational data, and even in the face of heroic assumptions.  The only alternative is to say nothing at all. We are not content to simply describe the world we live in. We want to overcome these barriers to causal inference, as best as possible. Consequently, epidemiologists have built tools for causal inference that are improving applied research, even in &amp;ldquo;gold-standard&amp;rdquo; RCTs. Causal thinking is thus not a detraction to pragmatic thinking – it is a consequence of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cause is our niche. Successful public health interventions are born of long, complex processes. A different expertise is required at each step in this process, and no person, or academic discipline, can master them all.  Thus, if an academic discipline is going to contribute to this process, it must occupy a useful space. The application of causal thinking is ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, I am troubled that we would sacrifice the continued development of epidemiological methods, especially those aimed at improving our causal inferences. I believe that any sacrifice to methodological rigour and innovation will do nothing but hasten us down the path to irrelevance. The solutions to our problems lie in more causal thinking, not less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galea provides examples of the kind of intervention research he would like to see published more often in our core journals. I believe that it is facile to say that we should engage more with interventions without clarifying our contribution.  At a glance, we can see that Galea&amp;rsquo;s examples ask fundamentally causal questions; and even though these papers are about interventions, the questions being asked are about relationships in observational data. A better goal then would be to bring our expertise to intervention research, or, if needed, to show interventionists what we bring to the table. Consequently, any sacrifice of our method would be counter-productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also fail to see how reducing methodological rigor and innovation will cure external dissatisfaction with &amp;ldquo;epidemiologic description and correlation&amp;rdquo;.  Most of this dissatisfaction has to do with the never-ending reporting of weak, often conflicting associations among every exposure/disease dyad under the sun (see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.lww.com/epidem/Citation/1993/05000/The_Hypothesis_Generating_Machine.12.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hypothesis Generating Machine&lt;/a&gt;). But this situation isn’t the result of obsession with cause, but rather the opposite (combined with perverse incentives to publish, and poor application of tools for statistical inference). Surely we should instead respond to our critics by continuing to improve the way we make inferences about correlations, and apply those methods more consistently as a profession. This of course requires more causal thinking, not less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also strongly disagree that the lack of &amp;ldquo;big wins&amp;rdquo; is an indictment of causal thinking. I offer a more likely explanation: we have already picked the low hanging fruit. All the big risk-ratios have been found, simply because they are the easiest to find. Now we are looking for needles in haystacks, and our necessary search for small effect sizes means that we should be striving for more methodological rigour, not less. If funders are walking away because we haven&amp;rsquo;t found the next tobacco-sized health risk, whom will they turn to? And how long will it take them to return once they realize poorer methodological rigour leads to even more ghost chases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the funders and policy makers do not appreciate our contributions, perhaps we must instead strive to help them appreciate what it is that we do. The field of economics doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have produced any big wins as of late, but they do undoubtedly have more sway with policy makers. Perhaps this is simply because more people know, or at least think they know, what an economist is. Conversely, my own mother still suspects that I am &amp;ldquo;some kind of skin doctor&amp;rdquo;. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is our problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I too agree that we must change the way we train epidemiologists, but what does an outcome orientated epidemiology training program look like? Which outcomes will programs focus on? How will these decisions be made? The beauty of training students on &amp;ldquo;our methods as tools&amp;rdquo; is that these can be applied to a variety of problems. I would argue instead for a greater emphasis on causal thinking at all levels of epidemiological training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this point I have argued that epidemiology in practice is already consequentialist in nature, and that our embrace of causal thinking and continued investment in methodological innovation is a reflection of this. Though I must agree with Professor Galea that our field faces important challenges, following from my position, I see no solutions in the dulling of our expertise. Quite the opposite. So in epidemiology, just like in life, there is no consequence without cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dantalus.github.io/img/crfc_banner.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-data-analysis-with-stata&#34;&gt;Introduction to data analysis with Stata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 24, 2017, the Clinical Research Facility Cork will host a one-day workshop featuring Stata data analysis and statistical software. It will take place in the Brookfield Health Sciences Building (G07) at University College Cork. The workshop will be led by Dr Darren Dahly, the Principal Statistician at the CRF-C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop is free for registered PhD students. Otherwise, the cost is 75 EUR and can be paid by credit card or purchase order (for UCC based attendees). To sign up, please email Darren (ddahly@ucc.ie). You will then be given payment details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop (9:45 to 16:15) will introduce Stata to researchers with little or no experience using it. Participants will learn how to load data and produce descriptive summaries, including tables and graphs, how to edit and modify data, and how to carry out analyses such as t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA and regression. We will also demonstrate how Stata can be used to support reproducible research practices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The perils of exploratory data analysis</title>
      <link>/post/2017-02-03-exploratory/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2017-02-03-exploratory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it ever ok to conduct an exploratory data analysis, for the purpose of &amp;ldquo;generating hypotheses&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question was motivated by a new Retraction Watch piece, &lt;a href=&#34;http://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/02/backlash-prompts-prominent-nutrition-researcher-reanalyze-multiple-papers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Backlash prompts prominent nutrition researcher to reanalyze multiple papers&lt;/a&gt;. It covers the backlash to an earlier blog post by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BrianWansink&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brian Wansink&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote about two early career researchers, one of whom took on several &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo; projects, vs. another who refused (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brianwansink.com/phd-advice/the-grad-student-who-never-said-no&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Grad student who never said no&lt;/a&gt;). The former managed to turn the &amp;ldquo;opportunity&amp;rdquo; into a small handful of publications, and Wansink&amp;rsquo;s thesis was that this is how you get ahead in academia. However, in writing the blog post, its author revealed a concerning approach to statistical inference, not to mention a cavalier attitude to the exploitation of early career scientists, both of which were quickly noted on twitter and in the blog&amp;rsquo;s comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/statsepi/status/809479929435979776&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;You can find the relevant tweets here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not here to pile on, but in the RW article, there was a quote from Professor Wansink that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P-hacking shouldn’t be confused with deep data dives – with figuring out why our results don’t look as perfect as we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With field studies, hypotheses usually don’t “come out” on the first data run.  But instead of dropping the study, a person contributes more to science by figuring out when the hypo worked and when it didn’t.  This is Plan B.  Perhaps your hypo worked during lunches but not dinners, or with small groups but not large groups. You don’t change your hypothesis, but you figure out where it worked and where it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/statsepi/status/827456005084704769&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I of course turned to twitter to express my outrage&lt;/a&gt;, and was suprised to find people supporting the idea that exploratory analyses were perfectly acceptable for &amp;ldquo;generating hypotheses&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately thought of this great paper by Philip Cole, titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.lww.com/epidem/Citation/1993/05000/The_Hypothesis_Generating_Machine_.12.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Hypothesis Generating Machine&lt;/a&gt;, in which he humourously claims to have compiled a list that contains every possible &amp;ldquo;X is associated with Y&amp;rdquo; hypothesis, making it pointless to try and identify any new ones.  It&amp;rsquo;s a short and entertaining read, and I encourage you to have a look for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People also seemed to think that exploratory analyses are ok in principle, but only if your explorations, regardless of their outcome, are reported. Obviously we can’t selectively report our &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo; explorations, and hide away the others (see the Texas sharpshooter fallacy; the garden of forking paths; file-dawer effects; and publication bias).  However,  I think people are missing the point that there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough hours in the day to actually do this. Even if you were just sharing summaries of your explorations, the time it would take to write them up would take up more time than the analyses themselves. Given that most of these analyses would lead nowhere, this would be a remarkable waste of researcher time, which is often publicly funded. So sure, exploratory analyses aren’t the end of the world - unless you take the point about selective reporting seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear about one last thing. I agree with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/f2harrell&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Frank Harell&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; point that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/robertstats/status/774112526489440256&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Using the data to guide the analysis is almost as dangerous as not doing so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. We should certainly use the data in front of us to guide modelling decisions, but this is &lt;em&gt;within the context of the scientific question at hand&lt;/em&gt; (unless I am misunderstanding Harell&amp;rsquo;s point). However, it is completely unscientific to suggest that you should look for subgroups for which you your &amp;ldquo;hypothesis works&amp;rdquo; if it didn&amp;rsquo;t work in the full sample. It&amp;rsquo;s exactly the logic that practitioners of so called alternative medicine use, when they point out that the treatment didn&amp;rsquo;t work, except in the people that it worked in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems aren’t trivial. This kind of thinking is damaging science. It has contributed to a bloated, garbage heap of published research. Most importantly, these problems are no longer just fodder for scientists to discuss over cocktails at international conferences. There are plenty of actors with a vested interest in eliminating the role science &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; play in public decision making, and those people are now actively using our methodological errors against us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As of today I am a Senior Lecturer at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucc.ie/en/crfc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clinical Research Facility Cork&lt;/a&gt;. I am feeling reflective. In the 5 short years following my PhD, I went from the USA, to England, to Brazil, to Ireland. I have gone from Lecturer, to Post-Doc, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_lecturer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Senior Lecturer&lt;/a&gt;, in that order. I started in pursuit of a career in public health nutrition, but now work primarily as a biostatistician conducting clinical research. It&amp;rsquo;s been a strange path, though &lt;em&gt;strange&lt;/em&gt; paths in academia are starting to feel awfully &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;. Apologies for my narcissism and any name dropping. I hope this is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1992-to-2003-fast-forward&#34;&gt;1992 to 2003 - Fast forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated high school and flunked out of college after 3 semesters. I spent 4 thankfully peaceful years in the United States Marine Corps, and went back to college to study biology. I wanted to go to medical school, but instead fell in love with public health, so I went to Hopkins for a masters in health sciences. I then spent a year working as a field epidemiologist in Togo. Following my growing interests in nutrition and epidemiology, I went to the University of North Carolina to pursue a PhD in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sph.unc.edu/nutr/unc-nutrition/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Department of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2003-to-2008-grad-school&#34;&gt;2003 to 2008 - Grad School&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My choice of PhD programs was fortuitous. I was supervised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://sph.unc.edu/profiles/linda-adair-phd/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linda Adair&lt;/a&gt;. With hindsight, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have worked with anyone better, and she remains a friend and mentor. The department was one of the best in the country for nutrition. I was fortunate to be a trainee at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cpc.unc.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Carolina Population Center&lt;/a&gt;, which was also nationally recognized for its excellence. Through the department and the Pop Center, I was able to learn from top scientists: Barry Popkin, Penny Gordon-Larsen, Jay Kaufman, Michael Emch, and Ken Bollen. I was publishing papers in good journals as a PhD student. I won a prestigious award for doctoral students in nutrition. I was making good money as an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12759&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NSF-IGERT&lt;/a&gt; trainee. I met my eventual &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dmanmama&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;. It was a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in statistical methods as a PhD student. I was conducting some fairly complicated analyses, and resented the idea that I needed to rely on these wizards called biostatisticians to do so. I was of course taught basic biostats as a masters and PhD student, but it felt grossly inadequate as I tried to grasp multilevel models and latent variables. I studied, and continue to study. The feeling of inadequacy remains today, but it&amp;rsquo;s motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years into my PhD, I presented a poster at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mrc-leu.soton.ac.uk/dohad/index.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DOHaD&lt;/a&gt; conference in Toronto. It was largely in response to a paper by &lt;a href=&#34;http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/profile/520/100/mark_s_gilthorpe&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mark Gilthorpe&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Leeds. A few years later I presented a better &lt;a href=&#34;http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/2/538.abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;poster related to the same topic&lt;/a&gt; at the DOHaD meeting in Perth. I ran into Mark again, as well as Robert West and George Ellison, and spent most evenings hanging out with them. They liked my work, we got on well, and in 2008 Mark encouraged me to apply for an Lecturer position at Leeds. I got the job, got married, and planned the moved to England as an ABD PhD student. Jay Kaufman teased that my life events stress scale must be off the charts. Barry Popkin said I would never again be able to work in the US as an academic. Off we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2008-to-2012-lecturer&#34;&gt;2008 to 2012 - Lecturer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was suddenly a Lecturer, realizing that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really taught how to be a Lecturer. I was handed a few classes to teach in a new masters program in nutrition and obesity. Shortly after, I was asked to manage the program. I foolishly agreed to do this. Hello deep end. I managed to write up my dissertation (it was described as &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo; by one advisor, which I thought was kind) and flew back to North Carolina to defend it in the Spring of 2009. I passed. To be honest I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember the defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I published two papers from my PhD and was presenting the results at conferences.
I successfully applied for a Medical Research Council fellowship. I had only been at Leeds for a year when I wrote the application, so I was feeling pretty good about things. However, I was straddling 2 research groups whose leaders didn&amp;rsquo;t get on particularly well. One of those groups changed institutes but I stayed put. There was more drama then there should have been, and certainly more than I should have been exposed to, but I emerged with no hard feelings, at least from my end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fellowship lightened my teaching load and the program I was managing went away due to the aforementioned drama. I wrote a book chapter, and helped design and deliver a related workshop on statistical models for lifecourse epidemiology. I chaired my first symposium. I published the last paper from my PhD dissertation. I started supervising my first PhD student, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/staff/otago072137.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cristina Cleghorn&lt;/a&gt;. I was collaborating on a amazing project called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@policy_communications/documents/web_document/wtp056927.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;COHORTS&lt;/a&gt;. But new, first-author papers weren&amp;rsquo;t coming. I just kept starting projects that were never finished before the next idea or task arrived. My wife and I also had our first kid around this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2013-brazil-to-ireland&#34;&gt;2013 - Brazil to Ireland&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three of us moved to Pelotas, Brazil so I could work with my fellowship &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epidemio-ufpel.org.br/site/content/faculty/detalhe.php?docente=19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;collaborators&lt;/a&gt;. The trip was delayed due to repeated miscommunications among administrators, so when we eventually left my wife was 4 months pregnant. Some people seem to think we did this impressive thing by moving to Brazil, with a 2 year-old in tow and one on the way. It was great experience seeing how my collaborators worked, I met some great people, and Brazil is lovely, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as productive a trip as I had hoped. I think I would still do it again, though I sometimes waver. I think my wife feels the same. I love her so much for going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month after we left for Brazil, the UK changed it&amp;rsquo;s immigration law in a way that applied to us. From that point forward, if you were out of the UK and your residence visa expired, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t reapply for 12 months. The UK government was thus able to report fewer immigrants for that quarter. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it up. Our options: I could return to the UK, leaving my pregnant wife and 2 year-old behind for a month, and renew our visas, all on my dime; or we could stay in Brazil and return after the 12 months. But there was an added wrinkle. Before we left, I was waiting to have my contract extended. I&amp;rsquo;m not here to point fingers, but something fell through the cracks, so there was still no extension. I was unofficially offered a short-term solution because someone approaching maternity leave, and assured something more permanent would come along. Notably, around this time, HR decided I wasn&amp;rsquo;t returnable in the REF as an early career researcher, since I was the named PI on a fellowship. The university apparatus was utterly unhelpful as I tried to find solutions to the visa and contract situations. Someone I liked and respected starting replying to my emails with HR-admin-speak. I have to admit, I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit bitter about this. At this point we stopped considering a return to Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: Shortly after all of this, Leeds started advertising their &lt;a href=&#34;http://250greatminds.leeds.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;250 Great Minds&lt;/a&gt; program. It was intended to recruit and support early career researchers that held existing fellowships. I already held one these fellowships, and needed support, but nobody outside of Mark had lifted a finger to help. Universities can be strange. It was salt in the wound, but moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.wellcome.ac.uk/2012/10/19/cesar-victora-30-years-of-brazil-cohort-studies/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cesar Victora&lt;/a&gt; very graciously said he would try to arrange a position for me as a visiting professor. I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget the comfort I found in Cesar&amp;rsquo;s generosity, and in another life, my wife and I would have jumped at it with both feet, but we were isolated in Pelotas, especially our toddler, and our Portuguese was coming very slowly. My wife and I were literally at a point where we were considering moving back to Los Angeles or Little Rock (our respective home towns), jobless. Then Janas Harrington, a collaborator in Cork, asked me to advertise a 3 year post-doc in her department on my blog. We had done some work together on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564930&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;latent variable models for dietary patterns&lt;/a&gt;. Like a lightning bolt, my wife asked whether I should apply. I checked the pay scales and learned it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a loss in pay since I would qualify as a senior postdoctoral researcher. I liked Janas, as well as the other people I had met from her &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ucc.ie/en/epid/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;department in Cork&lt;/a&gt;, Tony Fitzgerald and Ivan Perry. I inquired and applied. The interview was on a bad mobile connection in the Porto Alegre apartment my second son would soon be born in. I was well qualified for the post, but it had also been unfilled for quite some time, so I was offered the job soon after the call. We jumped at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2013-to-now-post-doc-to-senior-lecturer&#34;&gt;2013 to now - Post-Doc to Senior Lecturer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Leeds, I became less known for my research on early life nutrition (to the small degree that I was known at all!), and more for my methodological expertise, particularly with longitudinal and latent variable statistical models.   This carried over to Cork, where I joined a vibrant, active, successful department; but one with few academics as focused on statistics as I had become. Long-story short: After 18 months working as an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncri.ie/news/article/photos-ice-awards-conference-2014&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HRB funded ICE research fellow&lt;/a&gt; with Patricia Kearney, an excellent research leader, a Senior Lecturer post with a focus on statistics and data analysis was advertised in the Clinical Research Facility in Cork. I applied, twice, and was ultimately offered the job. Five-years, full time, and now a third kid on the way. Just in time. I feel very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That contract starts today, August 13, 2015. Thankfully everyone is away on holiday, and I could write this all down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with our PhD students and Research Assistants a few weeks ago and shared this story. A good discussion followed. There seemed to be some comfort that you can progress professionally, even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t a perfect academic or following a traditional route. Some of them appreciated that skills still matter, not just metrics. Others took note of how collaborations and networking can sometimes make the critical difference. Finally, a few told me it was just nice to hear about someone&amp;rsquo;s academic career path. If you made it this far, I hope you can say the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cork R-Users Group - First Meet-Up</title>
      <link>/post/2015-08-10-first-r-users/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2015 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2015-08-10-first-r-users/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all of you for joining the Cork R-Users group, especially the thirteen real-life human R-Users who met for the first time last week at our inaugural meet-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see a diverse group. I thought we were well balanced between academia and industry, and between statistics and data science. There were software engineers, biostatisticians, ecologists, data scientists, PhD students, and systems administrators. We had people with 10 plus years of experience with R, and people who had never used it but wanted to see what the fuss was about. Most of us had at least a few years of experience using R, but it was clear that everyone in the group was there because they wanted to learn more. Other reasons we wanted to create this group were to “Identify best practices…Learn what is possible…Solve Problems…Prevent errors,” and perhaps most importantly to, “Be around other people” that are as into data as we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified skills we could each share, as well as topics we wanted to learn more about. Based on this discussion we are planning sessions for the fall on &lt;strong&gt;Data Visualisation with ggplot2&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Building Shiny Apps&lt;/strong&gt;; and &lt;strong&gt;Using R with Spark&lt;/strong&gt;. We are also planning a hands-on, collaborative session on data cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people were happy to meet afternoons in the Western Gateway Building, but the sample selection here is obvious. It is thus critical for members to propose and organise meetings at other times, in other venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of organisation, Edward and Mervyn volunteered to help, and you are all very welcome to take the lead on whatever you are able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to get in touch with me for any reason (ddahly@ucc.ie, Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/statsepi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@statsepi&lt;/a&gt;). More information will be available on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cork-Ireland-R-Users-Group/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;meet-up.com page&lt;/a&gt; for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why share the data?</title>
      <link>/post/2015-06-15-sharing-data/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Research data should be shared. This view is widespread in academia and common among research funders. Regardless, most research datasets remain locked away. Sometimes data are held back for less than admirable reasons, but they can also be held back with good intent. For example, access to data is sometimes restricted in order to maximize opportunities for early career researchers to publish papers using the data. I believe this is instead counter-productive for ECRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-data-turns-ecrs-into-valuable-collaborators&#34;&gt;Open data turns ECRs into valuable collaborators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concern is that open data will attract tribes of competing researchers to publish results that you could have just as easily produced. In my experience, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Sharing the data instead turns researchers on your team into valuable collaborators, since their intimate knowledge of the data cannot be replaced by an outsider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-data-creates-healthy-incentives-to-get-work-done&#34;&gt;Open data creates healthy incentives to get work done&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the fear that someone else will beat you to the scoop is largely unfounded, I do think it creates an incentive to complete work in a timely fashion. It&amp;rsquo;s otherwise too easy to put work on the back-burner, where it often stays indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-sharing-is-now-a-neccessary-research-skill&#34;&gt;Data sharing is now a neccessary research skill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding applications now typically require a concrete plan for how you will share the data. Five years from now, you will not just need this data-sharing plan, you will also be competing with research teams with actual experience sharing data. It is thus important that you develop and demonstrate your data-sharing skills now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sharing-data-is-ethical&#34;&gt;Sharing data is ethical&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data aren&amp;rsquo;t yours. They belong to your participants, who have consented for you to use them for societal benefit. Further, you didn&amp;rsquo;t pay for the data to be collected. Yes, your blood, sweat and tears are in the project, but you were compensated for this. Thus any otherwise-reasonable action that limits the social value of the data is an unethical one. In my opinion, as soon as the pre-stated aims of a research project have been addressed, the data should be made as widely available as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is overweight, really?</title>
      <link>/post/2015-01-05-who-obesity-infographic/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/2015-01-05-who-obesity-infographic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The image below is from the WHO, and I don&amp;rsquo;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://darrendahly.github.io/img/whoOwOb.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top figure represents both &lt;em&gt;overweight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;obese&lt;/em&gt; people. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;According to the WHO&lt;/a&gt;, a person with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt; (BMI) of 25 or greater is overweight, while a person with a BMI of 30 or more is obese. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_894_(part1).pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WHO arrived at these numbers&lt;/a&gt; partly due to research comparing health outcomes across people with different BMIs. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60318-4/fulltext?_eventId=logout&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;These studies&lt;/a&gt; produce graphs like this one, which looks at mortality rate as a function of BMI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://darrendahly.github.io/img/bmiMortality.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk of death starts to rise rapidly as BMI increases beyond 30, thus the WHO definition of obesity. But what about a BMI of 25, which the WHO defines as overweight? Your risk of death is almost as low as it can go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a BMI of 25.7 is clearly very different than having a BMI of 33.1 in terms of health risks. So why do we so often see prevalence figures for obesity and overweight combined, as they are in the infographic above? Because it results in a bigger number, which makes your problem sound more important. Cynical, but true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an obesity researcher, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to draw attention to the problem, but we need to be careful and honest about how we do it. If I am a healthy person with a BMI of 25.5 and see this infographic, I&amp;rsquo;m probably scratching my head looking at that first figure, who has a BMI of about 42 by my estimation. Then I&amp;rsquo;m probably ignoring everything else I ever hear about the dangers of obesity, because I know that I&amp;rsquo;m not anything like &lt;em&gt;that thing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is unfortunate, because knowing you are overweight is useful, despite the fact it isn&amp;rsquo;t strongly related to poor health. This is because many people gain fat slowly across adulthood, and few experience sustained fat loss. As you continue to gain beyond a BMI of 25, health risks increase, slowly at first, and then more rapidly. Thus overweight is like a yellow traffic light, warning you that the path ahead is risky. It would be great if people better understood this, but in my opinion infographics like the one above undermine this understanding. (Side note: this perspective is very clearly outlined in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_854.pdf?ua=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;1995 technical report from the WHO on anthropometry&lt;/a&gt;. Just scroll down to the section on overweight adults.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what if I have a BMI of 32 (which is about right in my case) and see this infographic? Again, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at that bottom figure and completely discounting that it has anything to do with me. It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wiring-the-mind/201501/whats-wrong-fat-shaming&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fat shaming&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s likely counter-productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would I like to see instead? If I had the skills to make a decent infographic, I would start with the BMI/mortality graph above, add some traffic lights, and depict a person traveling along the path from better to poorer health as their BMI increases. I would also make sure to emphasize the health risks and other costs of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527647/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;morbid obesity&lt;/a&gt; which is becoming all &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldobesity.org/site_media/library/resource_images/Trends_in_morbid_obesity_adults_Oct_2014.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;too common&lt;/a&gt; in many places.&lt;/p&gt;
