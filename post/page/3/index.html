      Thanks to all of you for joining the Cork R-Users group, especially the thirteen real-life human R-Users who met for the first time last week at our inaugural meet-up.
I was happy to see a diverse group. I thought we were well balanced between academia and industry, and between statistics and data science. There were software engineers, biostatisticians, ecologists, data scientists, PhD students, and systems administrators. We had people with 10 plus years of experience with R, and people who had never used it but wanted to see what the fuss was about.

      Obesity can be defined as an accumulation of adipose tissue that deleteriously impacts health and well-being. How do we then measure obesity, as it’s defined here, for epidemiological studies aimed at identifying causes of obesity that may eventually form the basis for later public health intervention?
To do this, we need 2 things: a measure of adipose tissue; and a cut-point that indicates a level of adipose tissue that we think leads to “poor health and well-being.

      I recently read a paper (via @yusunbin) in the American Journal of Public Health concluding (among other things) that “infants sharing a sleep surface” was a contributor to Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUIDs; a classification that includes deaths due to SIDS, suffocation, or undetermined causes).
I was initially interested in the paper because, as a new parent, I know that the benefits and dangers of co-sleeping are hotly debated. On the one hand, there are well-meaning people that promote safe co-sleeping because it encourages breastfeeding (e.

      Heatmaps are a nice way displaying the values of lots of variables (columns), for lots of observations (rows). There are many ways to make them, but I prefer to use ggplot2 whenever possible. Use geom_tile, and treat the variable describing each observation (e.g. a unique ID number) as a factor variable. It is likely your data will need reshaping to a &ldquo;long&rdquo; format, which I&rsquo;ve done below with tidyr::gather.

      People often question the equity and efficiency of how research is published. One problem is the cost to access scientific research. Publishers sell a product that is initially provided to them for free. While the publisher pays to administrate peer-review of the paper, the real value-added contribution is provided free of charge by editors and reviewers. The publisher incurs costs for dissemination, but these have certainly come down over time. However, the journal prices do not seem to reflect these savings, a clear indicator of monopolistic behaviour that has led to massive profits for some publishers.

      People who know me know that I hate being asked how to lose weight. Yes, I study nutrition for a living. Yes, I teach a class called Obesity and Public Health. This doesn’t mean I have a satisfying answer to the question of how to lose weight. Instead, I have a very unsatisfying answer.

      Seán Millar and I were recently asked to review a paper. In his review, he pointed out the difference in predicting an outcome vs. identifying risk factors for an outcome. It is an important point I have clumsily tried to convey in other reviews, but he put it so nicely I asked if I could quote him here (I&rsquo;ve made a few small editorial changes, mainly intended to generalize what he wrote).

      Like many people, I used to compose tables for publication by typing or pasting values into cells. This is usually joyless, and always time consuming. The inevitable typos are are a nuisance, and having to remake multiple tables due to some minuscule change in the data or analysis is intolerable.
It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way. If you don&rsquo;t already know where I am going with this, read up on Reproducible Research and Literate Programming.
